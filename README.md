# [Geometric scaling law in real neuronal networks](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.138401)

geo-scaling.py is an example of generating network models with a tunable geometric criticality coefficient $\alpha$.

maxinfo.py is an example of calculating and plotting the information entropy as it varies with geometric criticality coefficient $\alpha$.

fun-criticality.py is an example of calculating and plotting the functional criticality induced. MPC varies with geometric criticality coefficient $\alpha$.

dataset/whole.npy includes the neuron's spatial information of whole brain drosophila connectome.
